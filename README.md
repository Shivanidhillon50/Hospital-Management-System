This project manages patients in a hospital using priority queues and file handling in C++. It allows users to add, display, and serve patients based on priority. Emergency patients are always treated before normal ones. Each patient has an ID, Name, Age, and Type (Emergency/Normal). The program uses a custom comparator for queue prioritization. It stores all records in a file named patients.txt for data persistence. When the program starts, data is automatically loaded from the file.
When a patient is added or served, the file is updated instantly. Normal patients follow FIFO (First-In, First-Out) order. The program uses a menu-driven interface for user interaction. Data is displayed neatly in a tabular format using iomanip. The queue ensures smooth hospital workflow simulation. Emergency cases are always given top priority. File handling ensures data is saved even after program exit. It demonstrates concepts of OOP, STL, and file streams. It helps beginners understand real-world queue management. Simple, interactive, and efficient hospital simulation system.
